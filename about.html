        <h2>who am i ?</h2>
        <p>
          as you must have understood by now, my name is padmanabhan
          subramanian. i work as a specialist for automotive infotainment tuner
          at BOSCH. a tricky question i get held at is what i am passionate
          about? it is hard to be passionate about just one thing, isn’t it?
        </p>
        <p>
          i enjoy design. who doesn’t, right? anyone gets passionate about
          design when they see one they like. I enjoy well thought out graphics
          design, anything minimalistic, creative and unusual architecture
          design, and a well detailed <span>3D</span> design. I spend some time
          sketching or learning blender, gimp, and figma.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy programming. still, a long way to go before I get my approval
          of being a good one at it. Getting hands dirty with programming
          languages like <span>C, C++</span>, Python, and web development
          languages like <span>HTML, CSS</span> and Javascript give me joy!
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy teaching. I believe everyone should share what they know. It
          only proves what one doesn’t know. I have thought basics of
          programming and <span>3D</span> at a computer institute after my
          education and it was fulfilling. I still get to teach a few
          engineering students basics of programming and software versioning
          over the weekends.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy riding my motorcycle. Riding my motorcycle gives me time to
          think and reflect on many things I would never ponder during my daily
          routine. Uncertainty during a ride is always I look forward to
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy learning. Learning about a lot of things; a lot of unrelated
          things if you ask. For work, I learn about the <span>SAF</span>e agile
          process and tuner module. I love cars and the technology which goes
          into cars. As a passion, I learn more about programming, the design of
          many things, and a bit of <span>G</span>erman language which isn’t
          moving too far.
